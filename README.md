## 5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar problem in the future:

- **Problem 1 (Account Class)**: Difficulty - **2/10**. I found this to be relatively straightforward and feel confident in solving similar problems in the future.
- **Problem 2 (Date Class)**: Difficulty - **3/10**. The formatting and structure were manageable, and I now understand how to use getters, setters, and `toString()` for formatted outputs.
- **Problem 3 (Time Class)**: Difficulty - **2/10**. The logic behind advancing or reducing time by one second was slightly tricky, but I feel confident after completing it.
